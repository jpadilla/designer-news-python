# designer-news [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jpadilla/designer-news-python.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jpadilla/designer-news-python)

Python client library for the [Designer News API](http://developers.news.layervault.com/). Inspired by the official [NodeJS client library](https://github.com/layervault/designer_news_js_client) by LayerVault.


## Install

Using Github:

```
git clone git@github.com:getblimp/blimp-python.git
```

Using pip:

```
pip install blimp
```

Using easy_install:

```
easy_install blimp
````

## Usage
You can make authenticated requests in two ways.

### Username and Password
```
from designer_news import DesignerNews


designer_news = DesignerNews(client_id, client_secret)
designer_news.authenticate(username, password)
designer_news.me()
```

### Access Token
The suggested way for authenticating users in your web applications is to
use OAuth2. This library does not include an oAuth2 client. [Read more](http://developers.news.layervault.com/#authentication-and-requesting-access-tokens).
